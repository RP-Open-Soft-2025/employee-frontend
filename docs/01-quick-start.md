# Quick Start

The Employee Experience AI Conversation Bot is a web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai) that can be used as a starting point for building your own AI applications for employee experience. The application is designed to be easily customizable and extendable, allowing you to add new features and integrations as needed.

Deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is the quickest way to get started with the Employee Experience AI Conversation Bot, as it automatically sets up the project by connecting to integrations and deploys it to the cloud. You can then later develop the project locally and push changes to the Vercel project.

### Pre-requisites:

- Vercel account and [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)
- GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account
- API Key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com)
